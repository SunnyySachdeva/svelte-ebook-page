    <p class="ligt-grey mb-1">I moved to Spain seven years ago. The process was painful and difficult. I
        learned most things the hard way: finding a job, getting a visa,
        calculating my cost of living, choosing an apartment. That's why I wrote
        this e-book, to tell you how I did it. No bullshit, no stress.</p>
